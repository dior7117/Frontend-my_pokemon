# Task

I did not have so many problems during this my-pokemon  project but there were problems 
from them there were problems in the operation of equal Button and there were also problems 
in the operation of screen cleaning button, and of course there was ham problems in button, who had to clean one single I want to mention a few of the ulardan:sammi.ac online Platforma, 
w3school, youtube , and other internet sites, from books related to react, from friends, and from our school mentors, 
I got a huge yomdam. I thank you very much to everyone who helped me during the execution of this project.
We have seen so far what React is and what it is capable of. To summarise in brief we got to know what React web-apps are, 
React Components, Props, States and lifecycle of a React component. We also created a basic clock application using
 all of the following. But React is a javascript library to build flexible User Interfaces, 
 and we have not created any so far. So it is time for us to step into the real world of React by creating
a simple yet impactful project.
Create a ReactJS Application.
It will be a single route application.

It should display the result of the operation.

You should be able to do multiple operation.
You should be able to clear the buffer.

# Description

All sorts of problems arose during the implementation of this my-pokemon  project from internet sites, 
as I said in the first question during the solution of these emerging problems, sammi.ac 
I got help from online platforna, the internet site w3 school, the help of my friends, 
and our school mentors, and of course I learned from books that were an inexhaustible 
source of knowledge and what I didn't know from the youtube platform, and got a lot of knowledge to 
solve the problems that arose in this project.
No more than 1 components per file.
Additionals components will be in src/components/
CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.
Your Readme will have to describe the project.
On the css/colors/design, you can be creative.
Your project will be hosted in the cloud (AWS/Gcloud/Azure/Netlify/...) and you write the url in  pokemon.url  Nothing more, just the URL.
You should be able to do multiple operation.
You should be able to clear the buffer.

# Installation

I wanted to use npm start to do this my_pokemon  project but npm start didn't work so 
I finished my project using visual studio Code to find out what level this project is going to be, 
and then I wrote it to do code from another.



# Usage

To run my pokemon, just type 'npm i' in the terminal
To run my pokemon, just type 'npm start' in the terminal
